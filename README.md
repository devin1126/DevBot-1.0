# DevBot-1.0
This repository contains all of the code that was used in the creation of the first iteration of my custom ROS-interfaced, surveillance robot coined the 'DevBot'. Please read below for details on the code, robot design, and more.

The code used in this project is split into two separate workspaces where 'devbot_ws' contains code that was ran directly on the robot and 'remote_ws' contains code that was ran on the remote computer that the robot was interfacing with.
